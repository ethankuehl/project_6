    "In this portion of the project, I utilize the [baseball_scraper](https://github.com/spilchen/baseball_scraper) package to scrape the statcast data for every pitch thrown in each season. Baseball_scraper uses selenium to scrape [Baseball Savant's Statcast website](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/csv-docs#pitch_type) to gather pitch-level data for each season. To gather pitch-level data for each season, I looked up the season start- and end-date for each season and plugged those dates into the statcast scraper function. \n",
